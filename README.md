School Project 3: Tessellations with Turtles

A tessellation is created when a shape is repeated over and over again covering a plane without any gaps or overlaps. Another word for a tessellation is a tiling. A regular tessellation means a tiling made up of congruent regular polygons.

Use Turtle graphics to draw a tessellation. 2 different shape, different fill and line colors, no space or overlaps. Use hexadecimal colorcodes to change colors!
